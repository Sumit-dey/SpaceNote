Routes to do:

In models for user, unsure if this is correct.
static associate(models) {
      User.hasMany(models.Note, {
        foreignKey: 'userId'
      });
      User.hasMany(models.Notebook, {
        foreignKey: "userId",
      });
    }

TO test routes in postman,
need xsrf token,cookie, and content-type from console, -> network, -> fetch
